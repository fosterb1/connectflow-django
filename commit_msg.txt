feat: add secure Super Admin initialization portal

- Created 'promote_me' view and template to allow internal team members to upgrade their accounts.
- Secured the portal using a PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY environment variable.
- Added URL routing for the initialization portal at /accounts/setup/promote/.
- This enables Super Admin access on restricted environments like Render without shell access.
