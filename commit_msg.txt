feat: add global role management to platform admin

- Implemented ability to promote users to SUPER_ADMIN directly from the Platform Admin UI.
- Updated user_permissions.html with a high-visibility Role Selection dropdown.
- Ensured promoted Super Admins receive is_staff and is_superuser flags for complete system access.
- This allows the master Super Admin to safely onboard other staff members to the platform management suite.
