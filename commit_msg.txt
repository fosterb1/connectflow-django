fix: load project_tags in templates to resolve Invalid Filter error

- Added {% load project_tags %} to base.html and user_permissions.html.
- This ensures custom filters like has_module_access and get_item are correctly recognized by the Django template engine.
- Fixed 500 error on login and platform management pages.
