# ConnectFlow Pro - Enterprise Collaboration Platform

ConnectFlow Pro is a high-performance, multi-tenant collaboration platform designed for modern organizations and joint ventures. It combines real-time messaging, hierarchical organizational management, and cross-company project synchronization into a secure, scalable ecosystem.

## 🚀 Key Enterprise Milestones (December 2025)

The platform has evolved into a production-ready SaaS with several critical hardening upgrades:

*   **SaaS Gatekeeper Logic:** Implemented a robust server-side enforcement layer that manages subscription plan limits (users, projects, and storage) and premium feature locks across both Web and REST API layers.
*   **Monetization Engine:** Fully integrated **Paystack** for automated recurring billing, featuring dynamic tier management and secure webhook handling.
*   **Platform Admin Suite:** A dedicated, icon-driven dashboard for internal team members (Super Admins) to manage global organizations, users, and subscription tiers.
*   **Multi-Platform REST API v1:** A comprehensive, JWT-secured API foundation ready for React Native/Flutter mobile integrations.
*   **Universal Media Delivery:** Standardized on Cloudinary with **Raw Storage** and forced **HTTPS** to ensure any file type (PDF, ZIP, Slides) is served securely and reliably.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Smart meeting detection for **Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, and Jitsi**, integrated directly into project timelines.
